# Validator_Set_solc_0.5.0
Sample Proof of Authority Validator Set contracts - updated for breaking changes introduced in solidity 0.5.0


Soidity 0.50 introduced breaking changes . More on this can be found here: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.0/050-breaking-changes.html

All was fine and dandy until I nuked my hard drive and unknowingly downloaded 0.5.0. then the pain began... could not find any
0.4.* version to work.

This is for the warriors out that..that happen to let go out soldity 0.4.* too early and can go back.

Bump your pragma up to 0.5.0 and live a little.


The contracts have been corrected to work with solidity 0.5.0 (so you dont spend hours swearing at laptop). In hindsight, it would have been way
quicker to grab the ABI off remix and downgrade my compilier  version. )
